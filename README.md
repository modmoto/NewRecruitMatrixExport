# How to use
- open a tournament in New Recruit e.g. https://www.newrecruit.eu/app/tournydetails?id=637cdec88d60d80e4641e078
- open the dev console with f12
- paste the code in the window "console" and press enter
- after 2-3 seconds the distilled teams with factions an player names should appear in the browser

# Adjust Outcome
- to change the playernames, just edit the text on the start of the file. E.g. Replace "Player 1" with "My Buddy". Make sure to leave the `,` and `'` where they are!
- you can add additional rows between the csv columns by changing the number in line 12 from 0 to something else. This will add an additional `,` between the players, so you can use the additional column as a comment or an additional rating field.
